AI for prosthetics

Competition summary: Recent advancements in material science and device technology have increased interest in creating prosthetics for improving human movement. Designing these devices, however, is difficult as it is costly and time-consuming to iterate through many designs. In this challenge, we explore using reinforcement learning techniques to train realistic, biomechanical models and approximate movement patterns of a patient with a prosthetic leg. Successful models will be key to better understand the human-prosthesis interaction, which will help to accelerate development of this field.
